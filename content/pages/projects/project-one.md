## SebbesGlobal-OT: Open Tibia Server 8.6

This project represents my deep dive into C++ development and game server architecture. SebbesGlobal-OT is a custom Open Tibia Server implementation that showcases my ability to work with complex systems and legacy codebases.

### Key Features

- **C++ Implementation**: Built using modern C++ practices while maintaining compatibility with classic Open Tibia protocols
- **Version 8.6 Support**: Optimized for the popular 8.6 client version
- **Global Systems**: Implemented comprehensive global mechanics and player interactions
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on server stability and performance under load

### Technical Highlights

The project demonstrates my understanding of:
- Object-oriented programming in C++
- Network programming and protocol handling
- Database integration and management
- Multi-threaded application development
- Memory management and optimization

### Learning Experience

Working on this project taught me valuable lessons about:
- Maintaining and improving legacy codebases
- Debugging complex systems
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Community-driven development

This project showcases my ability to take on challenging technical projects and see them through to completion, skills that I'm excited to bring to future development opportunities.
